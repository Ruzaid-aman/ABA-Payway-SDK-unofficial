# Changelog

## 1.1.1

### Added

- QR template generation test script (`scripts/test-all-qr-templates.ts`) — generates QR codes for all 10 PayWay sandbox templates at a configurable amount and saves PNG images + QR strings to disk.
- Transaction status check script (`scripts/check-qr-transactions.ts`) — fetches recent transactions via `getTransactionList`, queries detail for each via `getTransactionDetail`, and saves structured JSON results.
- End-to-end QR template verification: all 10 templates generate valid QR codes, all 10 paid transactions verified as APPROVED.
- Sandbox findings documented: QR API template constraints, transaction list/detail response shapes, rate limits, and status filter parameter format.

### Fixed

- `validateTransactionId()` now enforces PayWay's 20-character limit and `[a-zA-Z0-9\-]` character set, matching the actual API constraint discovered during sandbox testing.
- `status` filter in `getTransactionList` — documented that it requires string enum values (e.g. `"APPROVED"`), not numeric codes.

### Changed

- Updated `docs/SANDBOX-FINDINGS.md` with QR template generation and transaction status verification findings.
- Updated `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` with QR template verification milestone.

## 1.0.0

### Added

- Added SDK retry support with `maxRetries`, `retryDelayMs`, `onRequest`, and `onResponse` hooks.
- Added centralized request execution with `_executeFetch()` and exponential backoff.

- Added full OpenAPI response typing for checkout, credential-on-file, QR, refund, payout, payment link, and pre-auth methods.

### Fixed

- Hardened `PayWayAPIError` with safe `toJSON()` serialization, endpoint context, and retryability metadata.
- Improved retry handling for transient HTTP 5xx responses while preserving 4xx/200-business errors.

### Changed

- Bumped package version to `1.0.0`.
